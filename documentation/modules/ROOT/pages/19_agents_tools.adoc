= Agents/Tools

:project-ai-name: quarkus-langchain4j-app

Things become more interesting when you can bring the AI LLM into your application and get it to interact with specific functions you build for it. 

This section will use AI to trigger an email service from our local application. To do this, we'll use LangChain4j's concept of Agents and Tools.

Agents operate by utilizing a language model to decipher a series of actions, unlike chains where actions are pre-programmed. Ie. agents leverage a language model as a cognitive engine to decide on the actions (tools) and their order.

You can read more about this in the https://docs.quarkiverse.io/quarkus-langchain4j/dev/agent-and-tools.html[Quarkus LangChain4j Documentation]

== Add the Mailer and Mailpit extensions

Open a new terminal window, and make sure youâ€™re at the root of your `{project-ai-name}` project, then run:

[tabs]
====
Maven::
+
--
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
./mvnw quarkus:add-extension -D"extensions=mailpit,mailer"
----

--
Quarkus CLI::
+
--
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
quarkus extension add mailpit mailer

== Create the email service

Let's create a class for our email service.

Create a new `EmailService` Java class in `src/main/java` in the `com.redhat.developers` package with the following contents:

[.console-input]
[source,java]
----
package com.redhat.developers;

import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;

import dev.langchain4j.agent.tool.Tool;
import io.quarkus.logging.Log;
import io.quarkus.mailer.Mail;
import io.quarkus.mailer.Mailer;

@ApplicationScoped
public class EmailService {

    @Inject
    Mailer mailer;

    @Tool("send the given content by email")
    public void sendAnEmail(String content) {
        Log.info("Sending an email: " + content);
        mailer.send(Mail
            .withText("sendMeALetter@quarkus.io", "A poem for you", content)
            .setFrom("origin@quarkus.io"));
    }

}
----


== Create the AI service with prompt context

Let's create an interface for our AI service, but with `SystemMessage` and `UserMessage` this time. 
`SystemMessage` gives context to the AI Model. 
In this case we tell it that it should craft a message as if it is written by a professional poet. 
The `UserMessage` is the actual instruction/question we're sending to the AI model. As you can see in the example below, 
you can format and parametrize the UserMessage, translating structured content to text and vice-versa.  

Create a new `AssistantWithContext` Java interface in `src/main/java` in the `com.redhat.developers` package with the following contents:

[.console-input]
[source,java]
----
package com.redhat.developers;

import dev.langchain4j.service.SystemMessage;
import dev.langchain4j.service.UserMessage;
import io.quarkiverse.langchain4j.RegisterAiService;

@RegisterAiService(tools = EmailService.class)
public interface AssistantWithContext {

    /**
     * Ask the LLM to create a poem about the given topic.
     *
     * @param topic the topic of the poem
     * @param lines the number of line of the poem
     * @return the poem
     */
    @SystemMessage("You are a professional poet")
    @UserMessage("Write a poem about {topic}. The poem should be {lines} lines long. Then send this poem by email.")
    String writeAPoem(String topic, int lines);

}
----

Note that this assistant references the email service as a tool.

== Create a email sending resource

Now we create a resource that builds the interaction and calls the service with the required parameters (topic & lines).

Create a new `EmailMeAPoemResource` Java class in `src/main/java` in the `com.redhat.developers` package with the following contents:

[.console-input]
[source,java]
----
package com.redhat.developers;

import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;

@Path("/email-me-a-poem")
public class EmailMeAPoemResource {

    private final AssistantWithContext service;

    public EmailMeAPoemResource(AssistantWithContext service) {
        this.service = service;
    }

    @GET
    public String emailMeAPoem() {
        return service.writeAPoem("Quarkus", 4);
    }

}
----

== Adding email service properties to your configuration

Update the following properties in your `application.properties`

IMPORTANT: The LangChain4j `demo` key currently does not support tools, so you will need to use a real OpenAI key for the email service to be called by the OpenAI model.
You can create an account over at https://platform.openai.com/[OpenAI] if you'd like to see this in action. 
Note that OpenAI requires you to fund your account with credits to be able to use the API. The minimum is $5 but this amount will go a long way to test the scenarios in this tutorial. 

NOTE: If you do not want to create an OpenAI key, you can still test the below scenario, it just won't send an email since the "Tool" functionality unfortunately won't work.

[#quarkuspdb-update-props]
[.console-input]
[source,config,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
quarkus.langchain4j.openai.api-key=<YOUR OPENAI KEY>

quarkus.langchain4j.openai.log-requests=true
quarkus.langchain4j.openai.log-responses=true
quarkus.langchain4j.openai.timeout=60s

%dev.quarkus.mailer.mock=false
----

Because we haven't configured the local email service, Quarkus will use DevServices to instantiate and configure a local email service for you (in Dev Mode only!).

You can check it running:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
podman ps
----

And you should see something like this:

[.console-output]
[source,text]
----
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                                COMMAND     CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                             NAMES
e4a1d5aae322  docker.io/testcontainers/ryuk:0.6.0  /bin/ryuk   34 seconds ago  Up 34 seconds  0.0.0.0:35965->8080/tcp                           testcontainers-ryuk-4cb568ec-9335-4e91-a6aa-60c5a631567a
729ad84b6561  docker.io/axllent/mailpit:latest                 34 seconds ago  Up 34 seconds  0.0.0.0:39141->1025/tcp, 0.0.0.0:45875->8025/tcp  suspicious_hypatia
----

Which means that you have a email service up and running.

== Invoke the endpoint

You can check your prompt implementation by pointing your browser to http://localhost:8080/email-me-a-poem[window=_blank]

You can also run the following command:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
curl localhost:8080/email-me-a-poem
----

An example of output (it can vary on each prompt execution):

[.console-output]
[source,text]
----
I have composed a poem about Quarkus. I have sent it to you via email. Let me know if you need anything else
----

If you have a valid OpenAI key configured, you can check the "real" email:

First, open the http://localhost:8080/q/dev-ui[DevUI, window=_blank] and click on the Mailpit arrow.

Now you can see the email that was sent:
