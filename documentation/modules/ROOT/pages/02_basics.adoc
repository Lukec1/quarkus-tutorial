== Creating a Quarkus Application

[tabs%sync]
====

Maven::
+ 
--
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
mvn "io.quarkus.platform:quarkus-maven-plugin:create" -DprojectGroupId="com.redhat.developers" -DprojectArtifactId="tutorial-app" -DprojectVersion="1.0-SNAPSHOT" -Dextensions=rest
cd {project-name}

Quarkus CLI::
+
--
The quarkus CLI tool lets you create projects, manage extensions and do essential dev, build and deploy commands using the underlying project build tool in a simplified way. 

Follow these instructions to install Quarkus CLI: https://quarkus.io/guides/cli-tooling

Then create the application: 
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
quarkus create app -x rest com.redhat.developers:tutorial-app:1.0-SNAPSHOT
cd {project-name}
----
--
====

IMPORTANT: All the remaining parts of this tutorial assume that you'll be working inside the project folder that was just created. In this case, `{project-name}`.

== Build and Run the Quarkus Application

include::ROOT:partial$compile-and-run.adoc[]

Notice how *fast* Quarkus was ready to serve your requests. In this particular example Quarkus only required *0.019s* to start.

You can open your browser with the url `http://localhost:8080/hello[window="_blank"]` and you should see a response like `hello`.

Or else if you're a CLI person, you can run a `curl` command like:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
curl localhost:8080/hello
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
Hello from Quarkus REST
----

== Stopping the application

You can stop your running application by issuing a `CTRL+C` in your terminal.

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
INFO  [io.quarkus] (main) tutorial-app stopped in 0.035s
----

Quarkus was able to stop in just *0.035s*. Fast to start, fast to stop. Fast always!

== Testing your application

The scaffolding process also creates a test case for the example endpoint.

Check the file `GreetingResourceTest.java` in the folder `src/test/java` to see what a Quarkus integration test looks like.

When running this test, the application is started once, then all tests are executed, and finally, the application stops. Although it is not mandatory, by default the RestAssured project is used to test REST endpoints but it is up to you to change that.

You can run the test in your IDE or by running the following:

[tabs%sync]
====
Maven::
+ 
--
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
./mvnw clean test
----

--
Quarkus CLI::
+
--
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
quarkus test
----

NOTE: `quarkus test` starts tests in continuous testing mode (more about this below) so to return to the command line after the tests ran you will need to press kbd:[q].
--
====

== Open the Project in your IDE

Open or import the generated project into your IDE.

If you are using VS Code, you can open the project with:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
code .
----

NOTE: If you use `tutorial-tools`, your host `quarkus-tutorial/work` contains the application code; point your IDE to this directory.

== Live Coding (Development mode)

Stop the Quarkus application that might be running in JVM or native mode.

_Live Coding_ or _Development mode_ enables hot deployment with background compilation, which means that when you modify your Java files and/or your resource files and refresh your browser, these changes will automatically take effect.

This is probably one of the best features of Quarkus: enabling a very fast and productive iterative feedback loop.

Let's start the _Live Coding_ mode by using the `dev` command. You probably won't need to stop/start Quarkus again during this tutorial:

[tabs%sync]
====
Maven::
+ 
--
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
./mvnw quarkus:dev
----

--
Quarkus CLI::
+
--
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
quarkus dev
----
--
====

NOTE: By default Quarkus uses 'localhost' for the dev mode host setting. If you are working in a remote development environment, you may need to set the host to 0.0.0.0 by appending `-D"quarkus.http.host=0.0.0.0"` to the above command. 

== Dev UI

Quarkus ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode at http://localhost:8080/q/dev[/q/dev] by default.
It allows you to quickly visualize all the extensions currently loaded, see their status and go directly to their documentation.

== Continuous Testing (Development mode)

Quarkus supports continuous testing, meaning that your tests will run immediately after code changes were saved. Your application should already be running in dev mode.

At the bottom of the screen you should see the following:
[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
Tests paused
Press [r] to resume testing, [o] Toggle test output, [h] for more options>
----

Press `r` and the tests will start running. You should see the status change down the bottom of the screen as they are running, and it should finish similar to this:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
All 1 test is passing (0 skipped), 1 test was run in 11705ms. Tests completed at 16:02:32.
----

TIP: If you donâ€™t want to have continuous testing enabled, you can change this by adding `quarkus.test.continuous-testing=disabled` to your `src/main/resources/application.properties`. 

You can find more details about controlling continuous testing in https://quarkus.io/guides/continuous-testing#controlling-continuous-testing[this guide].
